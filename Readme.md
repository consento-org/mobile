# @consento/mobile

An app to handle your confidential data through people you trust.

# Our Mission
Our identities and confidential information turn digital. The challenge is to make sure that everyone remains in full control over their personally identifiable information.

A new digital society should not be one where people have to adapt to technology, but where our digital lives can be handled the same way as we learned to do in real life.
We believe encrypted data management can be redesigned with human trust at its core.

## Current state

With funding from the NGI we were able to build a MVP, which we now want to try with as many people as possible to make Consento grow and release an alpha version by the end of the year. 

Our guidelines for contributors can be found here:
